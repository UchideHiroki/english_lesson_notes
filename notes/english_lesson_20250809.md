  ```markdown
  I recently decided to go on an English study trip for two months. I’m going
  to Cebu Island in the Philippines, and I’ll stay at a school called
  “English Fella 2.” I had considered remaining in Japan and studying more
  intensively, but I thought that immersing myself in an English-only
  environment would be the key to success.
  ```

- **A文（B2強化）**

  ```markdown
  Having weighed the option of remaining in Japan and studying more intensively,
  I opted for full immersion: two months on Cebu Island in the Philippines at a
  school called “English Fella 2.” I believe that immersing myself in an
  English‑only environment around the clock is the key to success.
  ```

- **B文（口頭用・言いやすい最小修正）**

  ```markdown
  From a data engineer’s perspective, remote work has clear upsides and
  downsides. On the plus side, I get more deep‑work time: larger monitors,
  fewer distractions, and better tools that help my workflow. That said,
  collaboration gets harder. Even with Slack or Discord, real‑time
  back‑and‑forth, ideation, and ad hoc help work best face to face. Overall,
  the main advantage is better focus, while the main drawback is lower
  productivity in team collaboration.
